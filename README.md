# About Mindograph
Mindograph is a tool for visually organising ideas.
Every idea is a note, and every note is a node! Pin virtual notes to the virtual corkboard and link the notes with virtual red strings!

Download [latest version](https://github.com/KaniSama/Mindograph/raw/master/Mindograph%20Finale.zip).

# Disclaimer
Even though the version name contains the word "Release", the project is far from being finished. Because of this, you may lose all of the stuff you create with Mindograph. **Work with it at your own risk!**

# Controls
- Grab and move notes on their headers with LMB. Use MMB or Space+LMB to pan around the space and the mouse wheel to zoom.
- Press Home to reset zoom.
- Press numpad0 to create a new note
**(Be careful, there's no way to delete notes as of yet!)**
- Hold L while mouse-hovering over a note to start a link. Release L over another note to create a link.
- Double-click a note's header to pin it. Double-click the note's text to edit it.
- Hold S and LMB over a note to resize it **or** hold-drag LMB from the bottom-right corner of the note.
- Press Ctrl+S to save the project to the default file or Ctrl+ShiftS to create (or rewrite) a custom file. The location for savefiles is *%appdata%\CorkBoard\**. Press Ctrl+O to load a savefile.
**Remember to save your progress before you quit, the tool doesn't do that itself yet!**
- Press Ctrl+N to start a new mindmap. **Try not to save the new mindmap with Ctrl+S as that MAY rewrite the old mindmap!**
